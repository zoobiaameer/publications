abstract = {Summary Ternary semiconductors AB5C8 (A = Cu/Ag, B = In and C = S, Se or Te) have been investigated. The CuIn5S8 and AgIn5S8 have been synthesize in cubic spinel structure with space group (Fd3m), whereas CuIn5Se8, AgIn5Se8, CuIn5Te8 and AgIn5Te8 have tetragonal structures with space group P-42m. The relaxed crystal geometry, electrical properties such as electronic band structure and optoelectronic properties are predicted by using full potential method in this work. For the determination of relaxed crystal geometry, the gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) is used. All the studied compounds are semiconductors based on their band structures in agreement with the experimental results, and their bulk moduli are in the range 35 to 69â€‰GPa. Wide absorption peaks appeared in the visible to ultraviolet energy region indicating good absorption ability of these compounds. Therefore, these semiconductors are an excellent choice for optical devices, electrochemical and photovoltaic cells. These compounds have remarkable characteristics such as direct as well as indirect band gaps with very slight difference between the two, high absorption coefficient, good photo-stability, easy inter-conversion between n- and p-type semiconductors and in manufacturing of comparatively cheap homo and hetero junction structures. AB5C8 (A = Cu/Ag; B = In and C = S, Se, Te) compounds have shown high absorption and optical conductivity in the visible region. These compounds have therefore high potential to be used as solar energy harvesting. Also these systems are optical active in the ultraviolet region too therefore can be used for high frequency optoelectronics applications.},
